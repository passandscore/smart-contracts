# CrowdFunding

The CrowdFunding smart contract facilitates decentralized fundraising campaigns using ERC-20 tokens. It allows users to create campaigns, pledge tokens, manage campaign durations, and claim or refund pledged amounts based on campaign success.

Crowdfunding is a method of raising small amounts of money from a large number of people to fund a project or venture. It allows individuals or organizations to solicit contributions or investments from a wide audience. Crowdfunding campaigns can range from supporting creative projects, startup businesses, charitable causes, to personal financial needs.
