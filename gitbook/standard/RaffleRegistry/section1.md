## Security Considerations
1. **Access Control**: 
   - Only the contract owner can register or update raffles, mint or burn tokens. This is enforced using the `onlyOwner` modifier.
2. **Input Validation**: 
   - The contract validates input data to prevent empty or invalid names and URIs for raffles. The `InvalidInput` error is triggered if invalid inputs are provided.
3. **Existence Checks**: 
   - The contract checks for the existence of a raffle before updating it, preventing operations on non-existent raffles. The `RaffleDoesNotExist` error is triggered if an attempt is made to update a non-existent raffle.
4. **URI Management**: 
   - The `uri` function ensures that the correct URI is returned for each raffle, maintaining data integrity for raffle information.
5. **Token Operations**: 
   - The contract includes batch minting and burning functions for ERC1155 tokens, enabling efficient management of raffle winners. Proper checks and balances are in place to ensure that only the owner can perform these operations.
