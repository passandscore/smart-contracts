# RaffleRegistry

The RaffleRegistry smart contract is responsible for managing the assets of raffles created by third parties. These third party raffles require that an asset is available to be raffled off and provided to the winner.

# Example Scenario

A platform has thier own raffle smart contract that they use to manage raffles. They work with a partner who provides the assets to be raffled off. As the partner, you would use the RaffleRegistry smart contract to manage the assets that are available to be raffled off.

Once the raffle is completed, the winner addresses are provided to the RaffleRegistry contract and the assets are minted to the winners.
