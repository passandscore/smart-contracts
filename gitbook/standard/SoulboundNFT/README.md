# Soulbound NFT

The `SoulboundNFT` contract is an ERC721 standard non-fungible token (NFT) that restricts token transfers and includes features for minting and managing NFTs:

- **Minting Capability**: Allows the creation of new NFTs up to a specified maximum supply.
- **Max Mint Per Wallet**: Limits the number of NFTs that can be minted per wallet to prevent excessive minting.
- **No Transfer Capability**: Disables the transfer functionality for the NFTs, ensuring they remain soulbound to the owner.

The contract includes mechanisms to set metadata URIs, manage minting restrictions, and enforce transfer restrictions to maintain the integrity and uniqueness of the NFTs issued.
