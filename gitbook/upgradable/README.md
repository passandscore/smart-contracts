# Upgradable Solidity Contracts

These Solidity contracts are designed to be upgradable, utilizing an initializer function to set their initial state upon deployment. Unlike standard contracts that use constructors, upgradable contracts separate the initialization logic from the deployment process to facilitate future upgrades without losing state.
