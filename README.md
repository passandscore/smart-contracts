# Smart Contracts

Hey there! Welcome to my Smart Contract repository. This is where I've compiled all the smart contracts that I have created over the years. These contracts are written in Solidity, and contain unit tests created with Foundry. 

## Hacks-By-Example

Here you will find a collection of smart contracts that demonstrate common security vulnerabilities in smart contracts. These contracts are designed to be educational, and are not intended for deployment on the Ethereum mainnet. You are encouraged to study these contracts to understand how vulnerabilities can be exploited, and how to avoid them in your own smart contract development.

## What's Inside?

- Each smart contract contains unit tests created with Foundry.
- Each hack contract contains a article that explains the vulnerability and how it can be exploited.

## How to Use Them

Developers and auditors can use these contracts to learn about common security vulnerabilities in smart contracts. By studying these contracts, you can better understand how to avoid these vulnerabilities in your own smart contract development.

## Contributing

If you spot any issues in the contracts or have suggestions for improvements, please don't hesitate to [open an issue](link-to-issues) or send in a pull request. Your contributions help maintain the accuracy and relevance of these contracts.

## Get in Touch
